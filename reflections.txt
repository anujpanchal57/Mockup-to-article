Response : 

I feel like i have learned quite a new things in this course like how to create up to date webpages, how to tackle problems with different types of HTML Tags, etc

Most easiest part for me was to play with tags and make something new each and every time when i use them.

Difficult part for me was to work with relative and attribute paths.

Problem Solving Strategies used by me so far were pretty short and simple, when i was stuck up in any of the HTML context i would try my best to find were my some or the other thing had gone wrong and if this didn't work effectively then i used to take short breaks and then come back to the same problem and try to solve it more efficiently and i also took tremendous help from StackOverflow,Udacity Forums,MDN,etc.
